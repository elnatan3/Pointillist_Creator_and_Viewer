# Pointillist_Creator_and_Viewer
This is a Python code that consists of two modules, Pointillist Maker and Pointillist Viewer. The Pointillist Maker module creates a pointillist version of an image, and saves the result as a .art text file. The Pointillist Viewer module displays the .art file as a pointillist artwork in a window.


# Installation
To use this code, you need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download and install Python 3 from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/


This code uses the following libraries:

1. graphics
2. tkinter
3 .os
4. random
To install these libraries, open a terminal or command prompt, and type:
- pip install graphics
- pip install tkinter

os and random are built-in libraries in Python and do not need to be installed.

# Usage
1. To use the Pointillist Maker module, run the pointillist_maker.py file. You will be prompted to choose an image file. Once you have chosen an image file, the script will convert the image to a pointillist artwork and save the result as a .art file in the .art_files folder.

2. To use the Pointillist Viewer module, run the pointillist_viewer.py file. You will be prompted to choose a .art file that you want to display. Once you have chosen a .art file, the script will display the pointillist artwork in a window.

# Features
1. Pointillist Maker
a. Converts an image file to a pointillist version of the image

2. Pointillist Viewer
a. Displays a pointillist artwork in a window in square or rectangle whichever python file you run
b. Reads from a .art text file to retrieve the data for each circle in the artwork
c. Scales the x and y values to fit the window size
